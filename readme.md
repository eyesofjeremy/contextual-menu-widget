# Contextual Menu Widget

A WordPress plugin aiming to making adding menus quick and simple.
Add a location-based subnav menu to your sidebar. Looks for WP Custom Menus 
with a name based on the page's top-level parent's slug.
Originally built for a site in 2011.

## Installation

1. Upload the `contextual-menu-widget` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add a menu widget where desired through the 'Appearance > Widgets' interface

## Usage

Use this menu when you know you want a different menu to show up on different hierarchies
of pages, but you would like them all in the same sidebar location.
